# Stuck? having Issues?
If you get stuck or you did what the course said but somehow it is still borken, then that is a mistake on our part! If this happens we would love it if you created a new "issue" in the Issues tab describing the problem so that we can fix it and future students don't have to go through same thing you did! Need a response ASAP? Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/Gp7YEUkVHC I'm on there pretty regularly.
