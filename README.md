# Intro to Simplified Voxel Systems in Unity
An open source introductory course on making voxel engines in Unity. The goal is to use the least amount of code to achieve a simple voxel system that still achieves high performance. Join our Discord for announcements! https://discord.gg/Gp7YEUkVHC

# Making fun tutorials for this course
Instead of Excercises we use community made tutorials for each lecture. This is way funner, and makes learning feel less like a chore. Feel free to make tutuorials of experiments that you tried once you finished a lecture! Also no nowledge outside of the lectures should be assumed.

# Pre-requisites
You must already be familar with coding and using Unity for simple games.
If you don't already know how to use Unity but knwo how to code you can take our course for free

# Welcome
This course is mean't to be as accelerated as possible. I won't discuss my opinions much, or what I think. Instead we will try to be as consise and to the point as much as possible. We also only teach you something if you are going to need it. This leads to an extremely fast paced course, so you never get bored. You can view the source code of the final projects results here https://github.com/PaperPrototype/VoxelSystem

# Stuck? having Issues?
Make a new issue and we'll do our best to help you. We'll also probably fix the course so future students don't have any problems! Need a response ASAP? Join our Discord server https://discord.gg/Gp7YEUkVHC

# Lecture Format
 - Folders named "Week XXX" (XXX repesenting a number) stands for a lecture.
 - A file ending in .md is the actual text of the lecture.
 - The file names (for .md files) are named according to the language they are written in (example english.md). This allows the course to be translated into any language.
 - Folders named Notes contain the lectures overview and vocabulary. This is to be a quick reference so you don't have to re-read an entire lecture just to remember what a vertex or triangle is.
