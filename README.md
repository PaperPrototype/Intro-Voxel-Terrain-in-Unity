# Intro to Simplified Voxel Systems in Unity
An open source introductory course on making a voxel terrain system in Unity. For beginners to Unity that already know how to code (what functions, pointers, arrays, and return types are). The goal is to use the simplest code to achieve an easy to understand voxel terrain system that still achieves high performance using the JobSystem.

# Stuck? having Issues?
Join our Discord server to get help https://discord.gg/Gp7YEUkVHC and report issues. I'm on there pretty regularly.

If something is broken we would love it if you created a new "issue" in the Issues tab describing the problem so that we can fix it and future students don't have to go through same thing you did!
