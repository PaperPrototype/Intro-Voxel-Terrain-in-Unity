# Intro to Simplified VoxelSystems in Unity
An open source course on making a voxel engine in Unity. The goal is to use the least amount of code to achieve a simple voxel system that still achieves high performance.

# Pre-requisites
You must already be familar with coding and using Unity for simple games.
You will need a code editor. VS Code is recommended, it is much smaller than Visual Studio, and takes less time to download.

# Welcome
This course is mean't to be as accelerated as possible. I won't discuss my opinions much, or what I think. Instead we will try to be as consise and to the point as much as possible.

# Lecture Format
 - Folders named "Week XXX" (XXX repesenting a number) stands for a lecture.
 - A file ending in .md is the actual text of the lecture.
 - The file names (for .md files) are named according to the language they are written in (example english.md). This allows the course to be translated into any language.
 - Folders named Resources under a Week XXX folder contain images used in the lecture.
 - Folders named Notes contain the lectures overview and vocabulary. This is mean't to be a quick 
reference for anyone not wanting to have to re-read an entire lecture just to remeber ewhat a Vertex or Mesh triangle index is.

# Course Format
 - The course is divided into Weeks.
 - Resource Files from Affinity Designer (Where I design the pictures and art for lectures) is in the Resources Folder.
