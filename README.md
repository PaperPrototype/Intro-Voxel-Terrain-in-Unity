# Note from author
I am currently not developing this course as I am teaching a CS class. I will do more research and will update the course to include the missing sections:
- Last part of week 4
- weeks 5 to 7

I have to figure out a simple reliable (and forward compatible) solution to storing the terrain data for multiplayer and LOD systems. I want to be extremely simple like a Database store for the terrain. Performance is important, but simplicity of implementation is the most important. Feel free to reach out with solutions you've made. A good resource is Eldermarkkis Marching Cubes project https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Marching-Cubes-Terrain

The LOD section (week 5) may be added before the research is complete simply because it is hard to find tutorials on implementing Level of Detail (note it will be a cube based LOD system, not smooth terrain, but still cool).

# Intro to Simplified Voxel Systems in Unity
An open source introductory course on making a voxel terrain system in Unity. For beginners to Unity that already know how to code (what functions, pointers, arrays, and return types are). The goal is to use the simplest code to achieve an easy to understand voxel terrain system that still achieves high performance using the JobSystem.

# Pre-requisites
Basic coding and understanding of computers. 
Basic understanding of Unity.

# Stuck? having Issues?
Join our Discord server to get help https://discord.gg/Gp7YEUkVHC and report issues. I'm on there pretty regularly.

If something is broken we would love it if you created a new "issue" in the Issues tab describing the problem so that we can fix it and future students don't have to go through same thing you did!

# How to take this course
 - A file named "english.md" (or a different language) is the lecture that you need to read. Click on it to open it and start reading.
 - Folders with the word "Week" have a lecture and notes folder (with the lecture and notes in an english.md).
 - Folders named "Tutorial" contains tutorials for when you've finished a lecture and want to try out what you've learned!

# Contributing
If you want to contribute then read our [Guidelines](https://github.com/Nanite3D/Nanite-course-Guidelines) it shouldn't take you more than 1 minute to read. Seriously, it's super short.

# Currently being made
this course is still being written as you read this. Breaking changes may be introduced. Join the Discord for a changelog and one-on-one help from me https://discord.gg/Gp7YEUkVHC
