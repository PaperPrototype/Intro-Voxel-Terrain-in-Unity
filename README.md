# Format
Lectures teach concepts in simple examples, then lecture **tutorials** teach you how to apply those concepts. Why? By teaching concepts in the lectures and not difficult applications of the concepts you can learn the concepts easily.

# Pre-requisites
You must already be familar with coding and using Unity for simple games.
If you don't already know how to use Unity but knwo how to code you can take our course for free
