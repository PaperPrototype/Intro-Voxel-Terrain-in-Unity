# Intro to Simplified Voxel Systems in Unity
An open source course on making a voxel engine in Unity. The goal is to use the least amount of code to achieve a simple voxel system that still achieves high performance.

# Pre-requisites
You must already be familar with coding and using Unity for simple games.
You will need a code editor. VS Code is recommended, it is much smaller than Visual Studio, and takes less time to download.

# Welcome
This course is mean't to be as accelerated as possible. I won't discuss my opinions much, or what I think. Instead we will try to be as consise and to the point as much as possible. We also only teach you something if you are going to need it. This leads to an extremely fast paced course, so you never get bored. 

# Lecture Format
 - Folders named "Week XXX" (XXX repesenting a number) stands for a lecture.
 - A file ending in .md is the actual text of the lecture.
 - The file names (for .md files) are named according to the language they are written in (example english.md). This allows the course to be translated into any language.
 - Folders named Notes contain the lectures overview and vocabulary. This is to be a quick reference so you don't have to re-read an entire lecture just to remember what a vertex or triangle is.
