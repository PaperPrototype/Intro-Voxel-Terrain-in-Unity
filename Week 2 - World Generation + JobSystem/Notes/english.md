Octree
> An octree is a tree data-structure where each "node" has 8 children. This is what powers "infinite" detail or LOD (Level Of Detail) systems in some voxel engines. "Octrees are most often used to partition a three-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants." -- wikipedia
