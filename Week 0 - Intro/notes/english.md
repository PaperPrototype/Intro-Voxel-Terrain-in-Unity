Vertex (singular) - Vertices (plural)
    A 3D position used to tell where a mesh's triangle corners will be.
    
Index (singular) - Indexes? Indices? (plural)
    An index tells us where in a list, or array, we can find something.

Triangle(s)
    A set of 3 indexes telling us which vertices to use to make our triangle.
    The order that you put these ints affects the direction of the normals.

Normal(s)
    The direction that is 90 degrees "upwards" from a surface, for lighting purposes. Also the side of a triangle to render. Each vertex has a normal.

Unit Vector
    A vector who's magnitude is 1. The megnitude of a vector is just the distance from the start, or origin, to the "end" position that the vector is giving.
