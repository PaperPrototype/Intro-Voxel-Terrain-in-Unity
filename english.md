Pixels make up 2D pictures and worlds. The idea of Voxels is to make everything in a game out of 3D pixels or "voxels". 

Minecraft, Astroneer, SpaceEngineers, and NoMansSky are all games that use voxel systems for their terrain.
The biggest problems facing voxel technology:
- Storing voxels takes a lot of space (picture formats are large enough).
- Most graphics cards have hardware triangle rasterization (rasterization means filling in three points to make a triangle) which is extremely fast. On the other hand, there is no (or little) support for hardware voxel rasterization. Instead, we have to use software voxel rasterization or make the voxels out of triangles. Most voxel engines use triangles.
